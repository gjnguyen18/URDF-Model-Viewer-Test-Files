# URDF-Model-Viewer-Test-

Still wip

Model Viewer Page: https://gjnguyen18.github.io/urdf-loader-test/

All information about usage can be found in the 'Help' section of the page.

In general, everything is loaded from the raw files

When loading robots and objects from this repository, go to the raw urdf file, go to the raw version, and copy the URL
For motions, do the same with the excel/rmoo files.
Same with json scenes.

JSON Scenes can be appended to urls after adding '?jsonLink=' to have them load immediately. Can be done like this:
